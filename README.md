# fp-try

A simple TypeScript utility function for handling synchronous and asynchronous operations with a consistent result format.

## Why Use Try?

When working with synchronous or asynchronous operations in TypeScript, it's common to encounter errors that need to be handled gracefully. The `Try` function provides a convenient way to wrap these operations and handle errors in a consistent manner.

By using `Try`, you can:
- Avoid cluttering your code with `try`/`catch` blocks.
- Handle synchronous and asynchronous operations with the same function.
- Get a consistent result format (`Success` or `Failure`) for easy error handling.

## Usage

```typescript
import { Try } from 'jsr:@2or3godzillas/fp-try';

const syncResult = Try(() => {
 // some task that might throw
 return 'Hello, world!';
});

const asyncResult = await Try(() => {
 return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
   .then(response => response.json());
})

if (result.success) console.log(result.data);
else console.error(result.error);
```

The `Try` function takes a callback that contains your synchronous or asynchronous operation. It returns a `Success` object if the operation completes successfully, or a `Failure` object if an error occurs.

## Result Format

The `Try` function returns a result object with the following properties:

- `success`: A boolean indicating whether the operation succeeded (`true`) or failed (`false`).
- `failure`: A boolean indicating whether the operation failed (`true`) or succeeded (`false`).
- `data`: The result of the operation if it succeeded.
- `error`: The error object if the operation failed.

You can easily check the `success` or `failure` property to determine the outcome of the operation and handle the result accordingly.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the operation, the `Try` function captures it and returns a `Failure` object. If the error is an instance of the `Error` class, it is directly assigned to the `error` property. Otherwise, the error is stringified using `JSON.stringify()` and wrapped in a new `Error` object.
